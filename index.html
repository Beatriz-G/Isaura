                        <p>
                            Born & raised in Pomona, I would spend the weekends working with my parents at the Bel-Air swapmeet. 
                            Early mornings and long hot days would teach me the importance of hard work.  
                        </p>
                        <p>   
                            My weekdays would be full 
                            of essays, presentations, math tests, book reports, art projects, 
                            and most importantly... my path to Stanford University! 
                            I graduate class of 2010, with a smile on my face and pride like no other. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Flashforward to today and now I am a proud Pinployee ðŸ“Œ! 
                        </p>
                        <p>As a People Operations Specialist, I take pride in 
                            helping other Pinployees navigate the rather complicated world of human resources. 
                            Is there any greater feeling than sending out a well worded email?

                        <h2>People Operations Specialist</h2>
                        <p>As I navigated life after Stanford, <i>Go Cardinals!</i>, my career journey took me to unexpected places. 
                            I stepped into the role of AmeriCorps VISTA Member, helped create dignified jobs for low-income women at WAGES, 
                            managed my dad's business, and soon started to dabble in the world of human resources.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Not knowing that human resources would be my calling, I started working in HR while at TriNet. The role of 
                            Client Success Consultant seemed like a good place to rest 
                            and find myself while I looked for a career path better suited for me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ten years later, I am a proud member of the HR team at Pinterest! Umm, wasn't HR supposed to be a 
                            <i>temporary career path</i>?! 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My day to day at Pinterest requires a few things. Coffee being my top priority <i>(thanks PinCafe!)</i>... 
                            followed by perfectly crafted emails, smooth onboarding for new employees and a few calls with my fellow 
                            Pinployees! 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As I strive to create remarkable employee experiences through our onboarding process, I ensure that I am cultivating strong 
                            relationships with other Pinployees so that I create a safe space for those that are current and new employees. 
                            Human resources can be a complicated field, I strive to make it a little easier to understand and friendlier for
                            those that are seeking assistance.

                        <h2>Puzzles and Cookies</h2>
                        <p>
                            There is no greater pleasure than putting together a 1000 piece puzzle! The time I spend putting together a 
                            magical landscape, mythical creature or colorful scenery can be <i>therapeutic</i>. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You build a magical scenery piece by piece and get to see your hard work come together as a beautiful 
                            unicorn... or enchanted cottage... or a solid color!
                             The sweet feeling of setting down that last piece perfectly is rather magical. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Aside from building puzzles, I'd say my second love is eating fresh baked cookies! The warm gooey chocolate 
                            calls my name. Is there any better pairing that fresh baked cookies and ice cold milk? 
                        </p>
