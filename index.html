                            Born & raised in Pomona, I would spend the weekends working with my parents at the Bel-Air swapmeet. Early mornings and long hot days would teach
                            me the importance of hard work.  My weekdays would be full of essays, presentations, math tests, book reprots, art projects, and most importantly... my 
                            path to Stanford University! I graduate class of 2010, with a smile on my face and pride like no other. 
                            <br>
                            Flashforward to today and now I am a proud Pinployee ðŸ“Œ! As a People Operations Specialist, I take pride in helping other Pinployees navigate the 
                            rather complicated world of human resources. Is there any greater feeling than sending out a well worded email?

                    <h2>People Operations Specialist</h2>
                    <p>As I navigated life after Stanford, my career journey took me to unexpected places. 
                        I stepped into the role of AmeriCorps VISTA Member, helped create dignified jobs for low-income women at WAGES, 
                        managed my dad's business, and soon started to dabble in the world of human resources.
                        <br>
                        Not knowing that human resources would be my calling, I stepped into the role of Client Success Consultant at TriNet. 
                        It was just a temporary position until I found my main calling. 
                       
                        Ten years later, I am a proud member of the HR staff at Pinterest! Talk about a <i>temporary role</i>!
