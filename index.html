                            Born & raised in Pomona, I would spend the weekends working with my parents at the Bel-Air swapmeet. Early mornings and long hot days would teach
                            me the importance of hard work.  My weekdays would be full of essays, presentations, math tests, book reprots, art projects, and most importantly... my 
                            path to Stanford University! I graduate class of 2010, with a smile on my face and pride like no other. 
                            <br>
                            Flashforward to today and now I am a proud Pinployee ðŸ“Œ! As a People Operations Specialist, I take pride in helping other Pinployees navigate the 
                            rather complicated world of human resources. Is there any greater feeling than sending out a well worded email?

                        <h2>People Operations Specialist</h2>
                        <p>As I navigated life after Stanford, <i>Go Cardinals!</i>, my career journey took me to unexpected places. 
                            I stepped into the role of AmeriCorps VISTA Member, helped create dignified jobs for low-income women at WAGES, 
                            managed my dad's business, and soon started to dabble in the world of human resources.
                            <br>
                            Not knowing that human resources would be my calling, I started working in HR while at TriNet, the role of Client Success Consultant
                            seemed like a good place to rest and find myself while I looked for a career path better suited for me.
                            <br>
                            Ten years later, I am a proud member of the HR staff at Pinterest! Umm, wasn't HR supposed to be a <i>temporary career path</i>?! 
                            <br>
                            My day to day at Pinterest requires a few things. Coffee being my top priority <i>(thanks PinCafe!)</i>... followed by perfectly crafted 
                            emails, smooth onboarding for new employees and a few calls with my fellow Pinployees! As I strive to create remarkable employee experiences
                            through our onboarding process, I ensure that I am cultivating strong relationships with other Pinployees so that I 
                            create a safe space for those that are current and new employees. Human resources can be a complicated field, I strive to make it a little  
                            easier to understand and friendlier for those that are seeking assistance.

                        <h2>Puzzles and Cookies</h2>
                        <p>
                            There is no greater pleasure than putting together a 1000 piece puzzle! The time I spend putting together a magical landscape, mythical creature
                            or colorful scenery can be therapeutic. You build a magical scenery piece by piece and get to see it come alive when you apply that last piece.
                            The sweet feeling of setting down that last piece perfectly is rather magical. 
                            <br>
                            Aside from building puzzles, I'd say my second love is eating fresh baked cookies! The warm gooey chocolate calls my name. Is there any better pairing
                            that freash baked cookies and ice cold milk?
