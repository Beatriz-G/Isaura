                        Finding My Calling
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        As I navigated life after Stanford, <i>Go Cardinal!</i>, my career took me to unexpected places. 
                        I stepped into the role of AmeriCorps VISTA Member, helped create dignified jobs for low-income women at WAGES, 
                        managed my dad's business, and soon started to dabble in the world of human resources.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not knowing that human resources would be my calling, I started working in HR while at TriNet. The role of 
                        Client Success Consultant seemed like a good place to rest and find myself while I looked for a career path better 
                        suited for me. I had been eyeing the world of non-profits and possibly self employment, maybe even another degree? 
                        As I stepped deeper into my role of Client Success Consultant, I realized I really enjoyed reading up on the latest 
                        policy changes at work, and helping others understand those changes.

                        People Operations Specialist

                    <p>
                        Fast forward, I am now proud member of the People Team at <span>Pinterest!</span>

                    <p>
                        My day to day at <span>Pinterest</span> requires a few things. Coffee being my top priority 
                        (thanks <span>PinCafe!</span>)... followed by perfectly crafted emails, and a few friendly 
                        calls with my fellow <span>Pinployees!</span> As busy as the day gets, I make sure to carve time 
                        out and check-in with my co-workers. In the new post-COVID world it's even more important to check-in 
                        with each other, our mental health is top priority!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My goal is to create remarkable employee experiences. Human resources can be a 
                        complicated field, I strive to make it a little easier to understand and friendlier for all.
