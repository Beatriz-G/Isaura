                <h2>Finding My Calling</h2>
                <p>As I navigated life after Stanford, <i>Go Cardinals!</i>, my career journey took me to unexpected places. 
                    I stepped into the role of AmeriCorps VISTA Member, helped create dignified jobs for low-income women at WAGES, 
                    managed my dad's business, and soon started to dabble in the world of human resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not knowing that human resources would be my calling, I started working in HR while at TriNet. The role of 
                    Client Success Consultant seemed like a good place to rest and find myself while I looked for a career path better 
                    suited for me. I had been eyeing the world of non-profits and possibly self employment. As I stepped deeper into my role of 
                    Client Success Consultant, I realized I really enjoyed informing people, reading up on the latest policy changes at work, and just
                    helping others understand rules and regulations at work.

                <h2>People Operations Specialist</h2>
                    <p>
                        Ten years later, I am a proud member of the HR team at Pinterest! Umm, wasn't HR supposed to be a 
                        <span>temporary career path</span>?! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My day to day at Pinterest requires a few things. Coffee being my top priority <i>(thanks PinCafe!)</i>... 
                        followed by perfectly crafted emails, smooth onboarding for new employees and a few friendly calls with my fellow 
                        Pinployees! As busy as the day gets, I make sure to carve time out and check in with my co-workers. With Pinflex,
                        most of us work from home and venture into the office here and there. This only makes it more important to check-in with 
                        each other, our mental health is top priority!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As I strive to create remarkable employee experiences through our onboarding process, I ensure that I am cultivating strong 
                        relationships with other Pinployees so that I create a safe space for those that are current and new employees. 
                        Human resources can be a complicated field, I strive to make it a little easier to understand and friendlier for
                        those that are seeking assistance.
